# Work Day Scheduler

## About the application
This application is a handy tool used for scheduling your 9am-5pm work days. It allows a user to enter an event for a specific hour, and it also uses a coloring system to let you know if that event has happened, is currently happening, or is yet to come.

Light grey - Event has passed\
Red - The event is currently happening\
Green - the event is yet to come.
